\item{size}{Number of wells for plate, if \code{NULL}, the size will be guessed.}

\item{cex}{Numeric value as factor by which to expand the plot symbol.}

\item{alpha}{Transparency factor applied to plotting symbols.}

\item{main}{Optional character string to serve as plot title.}

\item{invert.y}{A \code{logical} value to invert y coordinates.}

\item{layout}{Optional layout for lattice plot grouped by file.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments handed to \code{\link[lattice]{xyplot}} including subset.}
