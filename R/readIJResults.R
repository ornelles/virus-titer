# readIJResults
#
# read data from ImageJ results file and extract infection parameters into a data.frame
# This program expects output from the ImageJ code "Multiwell Fluorescent Cell Count
# Expected values from ImageJ are: Area, Mean gray value, Center of Mass, Display label,
# and Inverted Y coordinates. Label must be of the form "xnn/filename" where xnn is the well
# such as "A01" or "b2". The ImageJ results file should have the multiplicity as an x value
# and a unit indicator (unit) coded as 1, 2, 3 or 4 for
# "VP per cell", "IU per cell", "ul per cell", "ml per cell"
#
# Arguments
#	f			optional ImageJ results text file
#	SEP			character used to separate directory and filename in ImageJ results file
#
# Dependencies
#	well.info()	parses well information
#
# Returns invisible raw data with extracted well, row, column, and positive (as FALSE)
